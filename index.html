                    <p>Hi!  My name is John.  A few years ago I retired from the healthcare industry after 25 rewarding years 
                        as a Magnetic Resonance Imaging Technologist.  I fiddled around with different smaller jobs mostly working
                        outdoors, but soon felt I was missing something.  Knowing I still have a lot to contribute, the ambitious side of 
                        me started snooping around computer programming as this has always piqued my intrest.  With a little research, I 
                        decided to enroll in a Full-Stack Web Development program offered at Denver University.  I hope to find a career 
                        in web development after completion of the course in six months.  Ultimately, I would like something remote but 
                        understand my options may be limited as a junior web developer.  This career is how I intend to spend the
                        remainder of my working life and I look forward to an exciting future with many options!
